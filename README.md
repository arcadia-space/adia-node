## What is Arcadia?

Arcadia is a digital currency for Arcadians. Arcadia holds an entire eco-system under which also "PAW", a subculture of it's own operates.

This node provides access to the network and supports transactions to both "adia" as well as "paw" addresses.

Addresses can start with "paw_" or "adia_" but are on the ledger considered the same when replaced with their counter prefix.

The main difference being that in the "PAW" subculture balances are displayed at a 10,000,000 PAW to 1 Adia (Arcadia) ratio.
